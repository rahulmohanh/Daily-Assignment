(12.04.22) tuesday

today we reached office by 9 am, had breakfast and began with my work, i was stuck with designing my app for a couple of days, and it was a little bit difficult than I thought it would be, my mentor asked me to think of every possibility that can be added to the app, designing is a difficult process as everything should be done on our own, so it takes time a little bit more than we expect, it was almost time for lunch and before lunch we had a session by Mr Earnest, he explained us about an apps UI (user interface), which includes the app what we see, its outlook, for example when we take an app in our phone like zomato, first thing we notice is that its logo pops up, and we are directed to the home screen , the main feature of the app is that we can order food, so every restaurents near by us and its menu is included in the home screen, it is made attractive for attracting their 
customers, so basically in UI, everything matters from appearance of the homescreen, the typing haptics, the colour of home screen etc, it is also 
important that the app must be easier to use, next was UX (User Experience),user experience maily focus on users experience while using the app, 
for example when we open an app like chrome while on a cricket match day for knowing the score, if it crashes due to some technical reasons, will the user have a good experience?, obviously No!, so that is why a UX team mainly focus on, to create a smooth user experience, so we will have a doubt what is the main difference between UI and UX the main difference is that UI deals with how the things look in an app and peoples interaction with it,
 while UX is how things work or how an app works when we click on something for example, we open zomato on our phone while clicking the app opens with in milli seconds, and redirect us to home screen, and we choose what we want to eat, and check out of the app by paying, so all these process goes through a transition from one page to another,  and that is what UX deals with, the process behind these transition. he ended his session by informing 
us about wire frame, so wire frame is the first step or early step needed to be considered before UI and UX phase, the usability and efficiency of final product or an app depend on how well the wireframe was created, wire frame is basically providing information roughly by a sketch ,before designingthis is very important step as the client side modifications can be made, can find errors and clear them in early stage avoid complication with in the team once the app is developing, our session was over and I went back to my designing process, and we reached our appartment by 7 pm.
