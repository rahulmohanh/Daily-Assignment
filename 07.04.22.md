Today we reached at the office by 9:00am,had breakfast and started doing our works I was stuck on designing my app, I had no idea what it should look like, then my mentor asked me to find out about physical machine, virtual machine,containarisation, kubernets etc, which were important aspects in cloud, he told me about these things last day I just had an overall idea about what these were and when he asked me about it today I tried recollecting what he told me the other day but missed out few important points,so he asked me to dig in more deeper, I was also searching for API in which I could only find out the overall outview of what API meant so full-form of API is Application Programming Interface, in order to make it more understandable 
we can look into it with an example, when I am using facebook in my phone , and I have it switch it from Facebook to some other application thats where API plays an important role, it mainly acts as a middle man in sharing these information while the app is being switched, they are mainly classified into 4 catogories, 1)open API, Partner API,Internal API, and composite API, then it was time for lunch, we had our lunch, and after lunch we had a session which was conducted by Mr Abraham, he continued on last days topic which was data went through components which consisted of string, numbers, boolean, and null, these components where necessary for a programming language, and he also mentioned that programming is a way of communicating with 
computers, and we have to provide the required inputs for a computer to perform specific tasks or function, he later concluded by conveying the importance of datatype which included 1) converion 2)operation, later the session was continued by Mr kaushik who gave us a brief idea about symbols, number, special characters which includes a set of information on what all should be included for getting a statement right, he also went through compilation which included lexial analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis,and understanding, all these factors must be considered when we are writing or reading things for us to understand, so if we are reading something and if it wont be in right format, we will not be able to understand what that 
really meant, so that is why it is important to write something in a specific format, same thing is also implied for computers, if we are not able to convey what we know in the right format to the computers it would not be able to understand what we are trying to convey to it, the session was over and we reached our appartements by 7pm.
