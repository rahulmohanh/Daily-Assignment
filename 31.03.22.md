(31.03.22) thursday
We reached office by 9am, had our breakfast and started dealing with our leftover works,mine was to think about an idea that solved a problem based on current condition, it could be any idea, I had no constrains, my mentor gave this particular assignment the day before yesterday, but could not 
figure out any solution on that day itself, but when I was walking back to my appartment I saw garbages everywhere and was struck by an idea of 
developing an app to collect waste from each and every house, so basically the idea is creating an app which can be registered using phone number, and enabling the location server of the customer by which location can be identified of registered number, so the person using the app can contact us for disposing waste, our team will come and collect waste from your door step, which encourages people from dumping waste in neighbourhood, these         collected wastes are sorted according to their respective types and plastic wastes are seperated and transported into recycling factories, other
bio-degradable wastes are transported to factories  that have ability to convert them into manures and fertilizers for growing plants, so this is just an outlook, which i proposed to my mentor and he pretty much liked the concept,he also suggested me to collect ideas regarding this application,Then I came back to html assignment which i was behind for 4 days,I had no clarity about how programming works, after 1 week of attending these sessions 
and interactions with experienced people working in SURFBOARD, slowly I started to gain some knowledge and clarity in this field,HTML is just the 
first step, and had many more to go!, after understanding few codes of html from google we had a session by afternoon which was lead by Mrs Rexilia,
it is very important to mention that in this internship, they are not following the traditional methord of teaching which is giving burden to students, they had an entirely different approach to be specific breakdown-teaching methord which is splitting a data or a topic which is huge into smaller and smaller groups by which it is easier to teach , easier to learn and understand the concepts thoroughly. she introduced us to two new codes one was
 for creating class and other was id and where these  can be implimented, after the session I came back to my learning process by the time we had our lunch, then my friends zaheen and ashein had presentations today, first zaheen presented about his app "ZE HIVE" which was a travelling app in which 
people can create a profile and search up for people who are travelling to the same location as the user, and travel along with them, once you find a match you can share your contact number and other information with them and make plans accordingly. Ashein presented about difference between UI and 
UX which was USER INTERFACE (UI) and USER INDEX (UX), he explained it using tinder as an example, by evening Mr Askin conducted a session about 
algorithms, as it was conducted in the evening we could only complete the introduction in which he explained what algorithm means ,it a set of 
procedure to complete a task and provided us with live example using ashein who was given a task of switching off A/C and we had to give commands
 regarding direction changes. our session was over and  reached our apartment by 7pm.
