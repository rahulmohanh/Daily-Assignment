(19.04.22) (tuesday)

Today we reached office by 9:15 am, had our breakfast and got into our works, since we were reaching the last days of the internship they had divided us into 2 groups (6 bits) and (fantastic 5), for our group assignments our team had 6 members me,adithya, gopi, ram, arun,and yuvanesh, and other team had zaheen, haridev, joshua, ashein and neelakandhan, so our team had to create an app  about a memory game, which we used to play in childhood,(identifying same images which are hidden behind blocks within a matrix). and other team had to input a word after logging in to a particular page and the computer have to check the spelling of the word, we had no idea about how these things work but was really curious to know, ram who was in our team had an idea about designing the home page and its outlook by using figma and gopi who was from computer science background had basics on html so they both had a little idea about how things should look like and what inputs to provide,I also helped them sharing my ideas and reframing in figma so that it would be easier while using flutter,in between these works we had a financial discipline session by Mr gokul, who was met by abraham anna, he is a charted accountant by profession, he started his session by 12 pm, he was not prepared for a speech which was a good,as he could speak his heart out, he gave us an idea about where to spend, where not to spend, keep a track of money that we spend and buy assets instead of liabilities, he also discussed about the book rich dad poor dad, and made clear that investing in lands is way better than buying property or appartements, he also discussed about buying gold jewellery,which does not give returns as that of land, and he also gave an example from his life that was, his dad bought a land in his name few years back instead of getting him a bike and the value of land now is almost equal to 45lakhs, onn the other hand if his father would have bought him a bike he would have to sell it in less than half the price he bought, he also mentioned investing in mutual funds and health insurances which are very important, as we can claim them on emergency situation, the hospital bills now a days are far beyound what we expect, so if we invest a little bit of our savings in these health insurances we can reduce the amount of tax we pay to our government and secure our family and ourselves when in need, it was such an interactive session we gained a lot of informations which are mentioned above and the session was over by 1 pm, then we got back into our work and figured out tags used in flutter, it was almost evening , we reached our appartement by 7pm.
