(20.04.22) wednesday
we reached office by 9:15 am, had breakfast and, started working on our group project, Gopi and Ram had almost finished the front end section of our project, using HTML and CSS, they explained me how things work , which tags were used, and also cleared that if i had any doubt regarding our project, I can check and clear my doubts by using inspect (Q), from the page,  which gives a clear cut view of each sections, then, I read the second chapter of Extreme Ownership book,
 In the second chapter, as its title suggested there is no bad team,only a bad leader,The members of SEAL team had a training session in water, it was a hell week for them as they had gone through tough trainings, the last training was to row boat to a particular target that they provided, and the members were divided into 6 different groups, Team 1 was performing well as they had a good leader, but team 6 came last almost everytime, as the commander noticed that team 1 was doing well, they decided to switch the leaders of those 2 boats, the leader of boat 1 did not like the idea at first but he had no choice, after switching the leadrs of the boat they found that the state of boat 6 improved way beyond expected, this just happend by replacing the leader, instead of re arranging the whole team, so, this is the basic principle that the author is conveying through this story that there is no bad team, only a bad leader,From the business perspective, Willink had an interaction with a Chief Technology Officer (CTO) whose performance fell below the expected standards. He was good at framing excuses and shifting blame to his juniors. After they had a talk with Willink, he was very reluctant in embracing the concept of extreme ownership. He advised the owners of the company to replace him because he felt the main problem was the CTO. After replacing the CTO, the company began to register improved performance and meeting its targets. The owners of the company contacted Willink to confirm that, indeed, it was not a matter of bad teams but rather bad leadership, 
then we had a session conducted by Ernest anna by 4 pm, who introduced us to basics of flutter, and shared his very basic idea that flutter is just playing around with widgets, by his session, we were aware of how to create a  widget, what are the functions that can be used, importing packages from flutter, then he told us about various classifications of widgets that includes row,coloumn, center,child, decoration etc, the session was over and we reached our appartement by 7 pm.
