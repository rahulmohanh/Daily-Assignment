(11.04.22) monday


Today we reached office by 9 am, had breakfast and started off with our works,I had to design my app in figma, but i was really confused on what it should look like what all features it must have etc, I started designing my app from the morning but it was not over, it was time for lunch, we had 
lunch, and after lunch we had html class by Mrs Rexilia, she mainly focused on providing us information on different types of classes, which included radio, text box etc, these codes were important as it can be used while creating a website, the radio class is commonly used while surfing through internet and filling necessary  fields such gender , we can find a small circle for choosing between our gender , it can also be used for other selections, but for our understanding it is mostly found while selecting gender, and other att was text box, which can be found while opening G-Mail, the boxes which are provided asking user name and password are mainly done by providing this input, after our HTML session we had a session conducted by Mr Askin, He continued with what was taught yesterday by Mr kaushik, and then introduced us to arrays, an array is a collection of similar data elements, which can be accessed directly, any elements can be stored in an array and can be accessed by its index number and items stored in an array is counted from 0 for example if we want to access a number from an array [1,2,3,4], so if we want to call 3 so we need to input array[2], so it shows 3 since, counting from 0 , 3 is in the second position, similarly, there are objects , they are collection of properties in key value pairs, an object name is created and inside curly bracket {}, we can input functions and it can be called anytime within the program by objectname.function throughout the program,for example we are creating an object const car, and inside curly brackets, we declare certain feature realted to the car such as its name, what engine it has, what type of fule must be used etc, so if we wanted to know what type of fuel must be filled anywhere in  a program, it can be called by 
(car.fuel), which is basically the name of the objecct and function declared in object. our session was over and we reached our appartement by 7pm.
