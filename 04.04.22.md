Today we reached office by 9 am, had breakfast, started with javascript, as I was new to programming language I had to start from the very basics so I inquired about how it is used and what can be done using javascript, it can be used to change html contents, change html attributes,css styles,hide html elements, show hidden html elements etc, I went through the codes of Javascript, which enabled us to do many things including assigning a value to a variable, to use arethematic operators for computing values, arethematic operators include (+,-,*,**,/,%,++,--), then I met my mentor who inquired me about my app (waste management), and to provide an out look of the app, which I did, he also asked me to do a presentation regarding the same,he 
also mentioned the factors such as what is the  app about, advantages, drawbacks, and what it solves needed to be sorted out during  the presentation,after the meeting we had a session conducted by Mr Askin, mainly concentrated on algorithm and discussed on problems given on last day, that session ended soon and Mr kaushik conducted a session about data and its operators, from the session we could collect what we were taught back in high school,about data and operators, but with more clarity, data is an information about anything,and operators are mainly classified into 2 arethematic operators and boolean operators as we discussed earlier arethematic operators are mainly used for operations including addition (+), subtraction (-),
 multiplication (*) ,  division (/), for finding reminder (%), increment (++), and decrement (--) given values, moving on to boolean operators, they are simple words used to combine keywords, and save time and effort, main boolean operators include AND(&&), GREATER THAN (>), LESS THAN (>), GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO (>=), LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO (<=), NOT EQUAL TO(!=) and EQUALS TO (==), it also consists of logical or (p^q) which can be used for proposition, and logical and (pvq), all these operators are required and used while programming hence it is important to know what is the application of all these operators, after the session we had lunch, discussed about algorithms which I couldnot find answers with my friends, then started researching on figma which was basically a graphic editor and prototyping tool (web based), can be used in MACOS, ANDROID<LINUX etc, the main function of this online platform is to design digital products,it enables designers and developers to edit, comment and review designs and codes together. these were the informations I could gather in a short span of time , since I had to start creating slides, I was confused on choosing a design, but found one,and started creating one, and it was time for us to leave the office, and reached our appartment by 7:30pm.
