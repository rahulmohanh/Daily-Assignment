(29.03.22) Tuesday
Today we reached the office by 8:45am, had breakfast and we discussed about the tasks given to us by our mentors, and started solving it, by 10:15 we hald a session held by Mr Kaushik about proposition, which are statements that are either true or false, there are various combination of proposition related to other proposition, it influences one statements truths one other, its a statement in always true sometimes never true. and he later continued with variables and connectors including logical and (^) in which  two statements can be linked with both statements true, logical or (v) in which two statements can be linked among which one of the statement must be true. session was over by 11;30, and we continued with our work, I was researching on flutter, which was basically a   framework (a tool that provides ready-made components that are customized in  order to speed up development) developed by google, it can be used to develop cross platform applications for android, ios,linux,macos,windows etc.Flutter is used for developing 
surfpay app, flutter apps are written in dart language which is a programming language designed for client development basically for web and mobile 
apps. it was time for lunch by then , we had our lunch, took a break and met my mentor who assigned me to find out what is application breakdown and 
apply it on any application, I had a little idea on application breakdown which was dividing an entire application into smaller groups based on its performance for instance if we consider WHATSAPP, there are many branches that built whatsapp, when we open whatsapp first thing we notice is chats, when we swipe to the left we can access camera which is another branch, it also includes status and calls as well, these are the main branches we can
 access when we open this  application, moving on to settings , it consists of branches including account, chats, notification, storage and data, helpand invite a friend. these branches contains sub-branches for instance, account is branched to privacy,security,two-step verification,change number,
request account info, delete my account, chats are sub-divided into theme,wallpaper, in chats there is a branch called branch settings which contains font size, enter is send (button),media visibility (button),archieved chats which is the second branch containing a (button) keep chats archieved,it 
also contain app language, notification branch contains light, use high priority notification (button), it has a branch known as groups which containsnotification tone ,vibrate, light,use high priority notification (button),and calls contains ringtone and vibrate,moving on to storage and data branchit contains manage storage,network usage which has use less data for calls (button),media auto download (when using mobile data,when connected to wifi,when roaming and finally media upload quality, and the final branch help it contains help center,contact us,terms and privacy policy and app info. 
after finishing the task we had a session lead by Mrs Rexilia who introduced us to basics of  HTML programming language and some of its codes to 
create a webpage, starting with( <html> ,"<head>"" "title" < /"head > [(<h1>" , "<h2>,<h3">,<h4">,<h5">,<h6">))]  can be used according to users choice of heading size,were <h1">" being bigger font and <"h6"> least sized font), <body"> "content"" </body>" "and finishing off with </html>"". other attributes can be added according to the creator, session ended by 5pm and we reached on our stay by 7 pm.
