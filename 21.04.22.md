(21.04.22) thursday
Today we reached office by 9am, had breakfast, started working on our group project, I was searching for basics of flutter programming, i had to be familiar with with the basics, after lunch we attended our first cultural talks conducted by abraham anna. He started off with an analogy between a chef and a cook and how they are different. Different people had different inputs but what he was looking for  was the difference in the level of risk each one of them was willig to take. The cook does not take risks while a chef takes risks. and then he moved on to talking about realities. He said that we  are not stuck in the middle of a predefined reality, we define our own reaity. That was definitely something to think about, and then he moved on to goals. He said that goals should fall in a common  area where your wants and reality can intersect. There are certain aspects of your reality that you can change inorder to work towards your goals and there are certain ascpects of your reality that you just cant change. He helped us understand that better with an example. He asked if he can have a goal to be a basketball player. and his present reality is that he is not very tall, he has poor stamina, he has poor physical coordination, and that he is old. Now in this reality, to work towards his goal, he can work on his stamina and coordination. But he cant get any younger or grow any taller. This was what he used to explain to us his point. Then once we all understoo, he asked us to go home and write down all our wants, check it with reality and filter down our goals and also to  write down why you want to achieve that goal. Then, after that, he talked about stress. Doing any activity is stressful for a person. Its just that different tasks give different amounts of stress For eg, for a certain person reading a book might be one of the lest stressfl tasks he can do, whereas for another person, reading a book can be very stressful. So when a person has to do some  stressful task, his brain automatically finds some other less stressful tasks first and keeo the stressful task for late. Every person has a stress limit. So when you do any task, stress of doing that task is stacked upon the stress of the other tasks you did beforre doing this task. So one should always try to finish their most stressful tasks first. That way you can be more productive, After the cultural talk session, we all went to srm, as bakeholicks had put up a stall in srm. So we all went there to see what all was there, tried to do some marketing for the stall and everything. It was great fun. we reached our appartement by 7pm.
