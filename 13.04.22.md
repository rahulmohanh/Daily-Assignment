(13.04.22) wednesday

On wednesday, we reached office by 9:00 am, had breakfast, and started working 
on our tasks, my app designing was almost coming to an end, had to plan on how
 the app should feel like when using, we had session before lunch  by Mr koushik, he introduced us to functions, different syntaxes and 2 stages of function which included, declaration and execution, so starting with function, he explained us about what does a function do how can we input a function which can be understood by computers, functions are instruction to create output from the inputs 
that we provide , for example if we want to add 2(2+2) numbers we can calculate it directly from our mind as we have trained our mind from childhood that (2+2 
is 4) but computers wont get the idea of logical operation no matter how hard we train them to think, so they must be provided with set of instructions that they can perform in order to conclude that (2+2=4), so this is were function plays an important role, in order to define a function, we need a set of predefined rules that are already created by some smart people which simplifies our effort, can be given inorder to get a certain output, so a syntax for a function can be defined in a program as - return-type (function name parameters),{ 
(function body)}, as I have mentioned earlier about 2 stages of function, 1)declaration- it is important to declare a function since the declared function tells the compiler about functions name, return type, parameters etc , now moving on to execution, the provided input to a funtion is called within a program is meant by execution, these things can be understood more clearly by an example, eg:
int a = 10
int b = 20 

void add (m,n)
{
  print(m+n)
}
add (a,b)

so in this example we have given the value of a as 10 and b as 20
and we need to add them , thus void add is provided, so it can be considered as a function so inside the function we declared print m+n, and outside the function we provide a function add(a,b) again, so while executing the compiler directlygoes in search of function declared outside main function ( here it is add(a,b),and this function is called upon by main function (void add (m,n), here m takes the value of a which is 10 and n takes up the value of b here 20 and adds these two numbers so result we can obtain is 30. so this is the basic methodology how to declare a function in a programing and how does things work as we declare and finally how it is being executed, to be more clear let us consider void add funtion in this program as a stack which consist of values a and b, when the funtion add (a,b) is called it creates another stack above the main stack,with values a as m and b as n so it can be concluded that it is a stack by stack procedure, our session was over and we reached our respective appartement by 7 pm.
