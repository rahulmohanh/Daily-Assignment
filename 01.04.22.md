It was last day of the week, reached our office by 9am,had breakfast, and started working, I continued with my html research, and started with CSS and its basic coding it mainly focused on styling html page like what should be the colour of web page created, which font style should be used in 
different sections, how to change colous of different fonts etc, CSS is mainly used inside html body and can be called from  another css  file, it is more preferable as html commands and css commands wont get mixed up, and it would be easier for the programmer to modify according to their need.     which can be <l.i.n.k r.e.l="s.t.y.l.e s.h.e.e.t" h.r.e.f="file name.c.s.s"> , then we had a session conducted by Mrs rexilia, who also explained the same about creating a seperate file for css and adding styles on programmers perspective. then we had lunch, took a break and got back to work I worked on researching various commands to be inserted on css files which was easily available on google and understood a few regarding how to change background colour of website, how to change colour of heading, how to insert an image, and how to add different styles of text (italic, bold)etc, then one 
 my friend Haridev had a presentation on the topic networking, he explained about what is networking how it it used in different sectors how is it
 classified and how are data transfered among these networks, then we had a session by Mr Askin about algorithm, the day before he informed us to 
conduct a task connecting algorithm, we were splitted into 3 groups , amoung which 2 of them contained 4 and 1 group contained 3 members, our group 
joshua, neelakandan, ashein and me, we created an algorithm of how to take pushup, ashein read the commands me and neelakandan did pushup, other team an algorithm based on arm wrestling, and other team did a task of creating a html file and opening a web site, Mr askin made us to do this since he 
wanted us to understand the concept of algorithm, he also shared his viewpoints on taking responsibilities, later that session we had other sesssion conducted by Mr anoop who explained us about presentation, he mainly stressed on how to present, what all factors should be considered before
 presentation, ways to know your audience, and he also adressed about ppt stylie, uniformality in presentation etc, then we left after the session got ready for playing football and splitted teams and started playing, I was so happy that day since we won both the matches played, it was fun playing 
every weekend as we all get to know each other well, and help us create a healthier relationship, it is also good for our body and refreshes our mind,
then we reached our appartement,took a shower and tried reading extreme ownwership book, which was told to be read from the day we joined this
 internship from the first few pages I had only a small understanding about the book,as the quote states "do not judge a book by its cover",I cannot
entirely know what it is about.
