Today we had dosa for our  breakfast, after breakfast we had an interactive session  with each other and started working on our assignments, I was 
researching on flutter,I went through home page of flutter and gathered as much information regarding the topic, since i had no idea about this 
I had to start from the scratch, then I met my mentor who assigned me with a task which was to watch a video about Javascript and find out where it is used and its coding methodologies. I watched a video but had many doubts,which I shared with my mentor about how a Javascript file should be saved   within a folder combining .css and .html files and which file do we run among these files, not only my mentor cleared my doubt but also gave a 
clearcut explanation on how Javascript works with html and css, generally Javascript is added to html using html tag <script>, it can be placed in    <body>,while HTML provides basic structure of sites, which is enhanced and modified by CSS and JavaScript, CSS mainly focus on presentation,formatting and layout, JavaScript is used to control behaviour of different elements and making web pages more interactive and dynamic.Then we had a session by Mr Kaushik by 12 pm, in which he remined us about truth tables with suitable examples,if p is the house painted in red and q be the house in the 
corner of the street, considering logical and (^) when both P and q are true p^q becomes true, when q becomes false p^q will be false, when p becomes false, p^q becomes false, and finally when p and q are false, p^q becomes false,so from these examples we got and idea that in logical and both the 
statements must be true in order to get a favourable true combination statement, next is logical or in which p and q are same examples which are p being house painted in red and q being the house in the corner of the street, according to logical or (v), if p is true and q is true pvq is true , if p is true and q is false pvq is true , if p is false and q is true pvq is true, and finally if p is false and q is false pvq is false, the basic concept of logical or is that either one statement must be true in order to get a true statement. next we have logical not (N), taking the previous examples
(p and q) if p is true, in logical not (N) it shows false and vice-versa, moving onto logical implication (-->), let us try to connect this with an 
example which is if you study you will get good marks,let p be you studying well and q be you will get good marks, applying this on logical 
implication, if p is true and q is true p-->q is true, if p is true and q is false p-->q is false, if p is false and q is true then p-->q is true. if p is false and q is also false then p-->q is true which can be summarized as, p is a condition and q being the target to achieve, finally moving onto logical biconditional( <-->) applying same example as previous logical implication, were p is true and q is true p<-->q is true, p is true and q is 
false p<-->q is false, p is false and q is true p<-->q is false and if both the statements are false p<-->q is true. we were on our respective stays 
by 7:30pm.
