We reached office by 9 am, had breakfast, and started preparing on my presentation, it was by 12;30 pm but later got postponded to 4 pm, I was a bit 
nervous as it was my first time presenting, and that day my friend ashein also had presentation, after lunch, we gathered and presented my idea, after my presentation ashein presented about various steps in app developement, which included, building idea, market research, building app wire frame,
plateform choice, development, testing of app, and finally launching the application, then we had a session by Mr Kaushik, through out his session he
mentioned how computers work, what all can be done to make computer understand what we wanted, what are the basic structure of providing input etc, 
he also mentioned that computers are dumb, as it needed explanation for every inputs we provide and it does not have a sense of thinking, and programming language is the only option to communicate with them, for example if we want to multiply 2 numbers,like 2*3 our mind directly jumps to 6 from our experiences and our understanding, but for computers it is difficult for them to understand this concept and each time we have to input number and 
call them when required,this is mainly they cant remember things and only workout on things that we provide them, he also went through different
 operators and characters which is used in javascript, and introduced us to parameters in dart language, which was the languge used in flutter, some of them include int it is used to input a variable ( int variable), which can be called anytime within the program, bool value (to know if a provided statement is true or false), double can be used to input numbers having decimal points, and string name this field should be filled in double codes "",all these are primitive data type and their syntaxes, and he also went through errors that can occur while running a code which includes compile time error and run time error,
