Today we reached at the office by 9 am, had breakfast, and started working on our assignments, mine was to prepare ppt for my presentation and know 
basic functions of FIGMA, so figma is an online platform which can be used for designing website application,  logos etc, it is easy to use and has
 wide varieties of styles to choose from, and it is free to use, making it different from other competitors. it has many shortcuts which saves us many time while using the app to design something, for example, we are creating a login page of an app, the rectangular components of the page can be 
called using (R), likewise many other shortcuts, we can choose from variety of designs within the webpage, then I met my mentor whohad given me a task to find out other application which are being developed in surfboard , after preparing the slides for presentation ,I was curious to know which are 
the other apps being developed here (in surfboard), but it was lunch time and everybody was having lunch, after lunch I enquired about the apps to 
Mrs Pooja, she told me about apps which included, (Rejucated, Term, Hope, Checkout and Surfpay), I was surprised to know about these apps were being 
designed and build along with surfpay application, after knowing these apps I wanted to know what was these apps about,in order to get more details
 regarding these applications Mr anoop who is working as a technical writer in the company helped me a lot,  The first app was Rejucated,this app comes under the category of Learning Management System or commonly known as (L.M.S), which is a software application, that provides framework, handling all aspects of learning process main example can be BYJUS who are well known in this sector, they are providing assistance for school students by online pre-recorded classes, so that students can understand the concept of what they are learning, so Rejucated is an initiative which was developed by 
surfboard members, which was lead by Mrs Rexilia, the next app was Terms, so this app they are planning about providing an ownership program to 
 entrepreneurs who are interested in developing their skills in entrepreneurship, this app was  developed by Mr Ernest, using this app people who are planning to develope their skill , people who are planning to build a business venture , or people who have ideas in different field can develope their by registering on the above mentioned ownership program, next was Hope , which was a donation platform,o it was mainly an app in which people 
can present thier ideas on any topic which can be seen by other people,and if they find that idea worthy they can fund the idea and the income 
generated from these ideas are used as reserved fund, which can be used in emergency situations, these are just  outlook of  these apps which I could collect with in a short span of time and my curiosity for knowing more about these apps increased, we reached our alloted appartements by 7pm.
