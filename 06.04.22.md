(06.04.22) wednesday

Today we reached office by 9:15, had breakfast and started working, after preparing ppt, i started to design my application (waste management app), as my mentor asked me to create first two pages of my app which I did, but it took me a while since I was not an expert in the field, it was time for
lunch, we had lunch and got back into my work after lunch we had session which was conducted by Mr Abraham, who is the C.T.O of the company surfboard,he started on the topic data, it was a very interactive session as he kept asking questions, in earlier classes my mentor asked me to find out what
 breakdown was,which is splitting a large object into smaller and smaller groups, and throughout this session, Mr Abraham explained every detail in 
that manner, he asked us about data, which was a set of information, computers are not smart enough as human beings so these information cannot be
 acceptable to computers , the only language known to computer is binary language which mainly consists of 0 and 1's, even boolean value (True/False)
has to be converted into binary language, so we had a curiosity that how the commands that we input is converted into binary? for example if we type a letter "A" through keyboard, the value of A is not directly read by the computer, a set of predefined values are stored in ASCII code (American Standard Code for Information Interchange), so the value for "A" from ASCII code is (065), so when A is typed this value is called and the value is given 
to computer, and finally A can be seen on screen, but these procedures takes place faster lets say with in seconds, hence we do not feel a lag, then 
he briefly described what UTF-8 and UTF-16 was, UTF-8 (unicode transformation format)which translated character to matching binary string and vice 
versa, it was mainly used in computers(8 bits),  and UTF-16 is used in phones since usage of multiple languages,then my mentor introduced me to cloud section of surfpay app, and he explained each process in detail,this is just an overview or a piece of information which I understood, which is an app is developed by a developer and it is tested by testing team , the developng team include front end and back end developers who are into most of the coding, and any faults in the app can be found while testing, after a series of testing when the product is ready to launch, pilot mode is created,
 and deployed into cloud section , initially there would be less customers, but as soon as the number of customers increase, the app should work 
properly regardless of the traffic , the main function ofcloud service is to always keep the servers active which prevent the app from crashing due to traffic, he also explained how it is done, the physical machine or the computer which he uses abstracts the data from the physical machine into
 virtual machine here abstraction can be understood with an example, imagine how we used to go for shopping in potheys or to get groceries from, more?
in the case of shopping clothes we had certain sets of requirements, like colour size, design etc and all these hardwork changed once myntra was introduced our shopping experience was way more easier than the traditional methord, this is exactly what abstraction do, they sums up our requirements and take what is really necessary for an application to run and transfer them to virtual machines , the example was clarified by my mentor, which made me understand the topic very clearly, the need for transferring them to virtual machines were once the physical machine is damaged our programs will be lost forever, as we cannot do anything about it, in order to avoid such situation we need to abstract it to virtual machine,and the data is abstracted and containarisation is done which is a large file is made into a small file , eg, ubuntu is actually 4gb, so by containarisation it can be made into 24 mb, and it is deployed to kubernetes they arrange the deployed file, and they are uploaded to google drive finally, which is the master cloud. after discussion my mentor bought me an apple juice, which tasted amazing, and I reached my appartement by 7 pm.
